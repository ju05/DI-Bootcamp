# üåü Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions
# Using this code:

class Pets():
    def __init__(self, animals):
        self.animals = animals

    def walk(self):
        for animal in self.animals:
            print(animal.walk())

class Cat():
    is_lazy = True

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def walk(self):
        return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

class Bengal(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'

class Chartreux(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'
class Siamese(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'

bengal = Bengal('bengal', 10)
chartreux = Chartreux('chartreux', 5)
siamese = Siamese('siamese', 7)
all_cats = [bengal, chartreux, siamese]
sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)
sara_pets.walk()

# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara‚Äôs pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight
    def bark(self):
        print(f'{self.name} is barking')
    def run_speed(self):
        run = int((self.weight / self.age * 10))
        print(f'{self.name} runs {run}')
        return run
    def fight(self, other_dog):
        power1 = self.run_speed()
        if power1 * self.weight > other_dog.run_speed() * other_dog.weight:
            print(f'{self.name} won the fight')
        else:
            print(f'{other_dog.name} won the fight')

dog1 = Dog('Jr', 12, 10)
dog2 = Dog('Leao', 7, 15)
dog3 = Dog('Frida', 9, 12)
dog1.bark()
dog2.bark()
dog3.bark()
dog1.run_speed()
dog2.run_speed()
dog3.run_speed()
dog1.fight(dog2)
                          
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: ‚Äú<dog_name> is barking‚Äù.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.


# üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.
