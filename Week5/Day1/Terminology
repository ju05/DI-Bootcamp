In object-oriented programming, concepts are modeled as classes and objects. 
An idea is defined using a class, and an INSTANCE of this class is called an object. 
Almost everything in Python is an object, including strings, lists, dictionaries, and numbers. 
When we create a list in Python, weâ€™re creating an object which is an instance of the list class, which represents the concept of a list. 
Classes also have attributes and methods associated with them. 
Attributes are the characteristics of the class, while methods are functions that are part of the class.

How can i check witch class is some data type in python?
>>> type(3)
<class 'int'>
>>>type("")
<class 'str'>

Use dir(type of data) and help(type of data) functions to see all the documentation about the type of data you want.
ex.: dir("") will return the documentation about strings
type "q" to quit and exit the documentation

Attributes are the characteristics associated to a type.
Ex.: a file has attributes such as: name, size, date, permissions, etc

Methods are the functions associated to a type.
Ex.:for a file: create, edditing, deleting, adding, etc

The syntax used to access the attributes is called DOT NOTATION because of the dot used in the expression. 
Dot notation lets you access any of the abilities that the object might have, called methods or information that it might store called attributes.
