# # üåü Exercise 2: Tuple
# # Instructions
# # Given a tuple which value is integers, is it possible to add more integers to the tuple?
# # my_tuple = 1,5,15,21,24
# # my_tuple.add(11)
# # answer: It`s not possible to add something to a tuple.`

# # üåü Exercise 3: List
# # Instructions
# # Using this list 
# basket = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]
# # Remove ‚ÄúBanana‚Äù from the list.

# # üåü Exercise 4: Floats
# # Instructions
# # Recap ‚Äì What is a float? What is the difference between an integer and a float?
# # integer is a whole number and float is a decimal number
# # Can you think of another way to generate a sequence of floats?
# # Create a list containing the following sequence 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 (don‚Äôt hard-code the sequence).
# sequence = []
# num = 1.5
# sequence.append(num)
# for i in range (2,6):
#     decimal =  i + 0.5
#     sequence.append(i)
#     sequence.append(decimal)
# print(sequence)

# # üåü Exercise 5: For Loop
# # Instructions
# # Use a for loop to print all numbers from 1 to 20, inclusive.
# # Using a for loop, that loops from 1 to 20(inclusive), print out every element which has an even index.
# for i in range(1,21):
#     if (i % 2 == 0):
#         print(i)
# for j in range(1,21):
#     print(j)

# üåü Exercise 6 : While Loop
# Instructions
# Write a while loop that will continuously ask the user for their name, unless the input is equal to your name.
# while True:
#     user_name = input("Enter your name")
#     if user_name == "Juliana":
#         break

# üåü Exercise 7: Favorite Fruits
# Instructions
# Ask the user to input their favorite fruit(s) (one or several fruits).
from cmd import PROMPT


user_fruits = input("Enter your favorite fruits separated with a single space")
fruits_list = []
fruits_tolist = user_fruits.split()
fruits_list.append(fruits_tolist)
print(fruits_list)
new_fruit = input("Enter any fruit")
exist_fruit = fruits_list.count(new_fruit) 
# checking if it is more then 0
if exist_fruit > 0:
    print("You chose one of your favorite fruits! Enjoy!")
else:
    print(exist_fruit)
    print("You chose a new fruit. I hope you enjoy")
# # Hint : Use the built in input method. Ask the user to separate the fruits with a single space, eg. "apple mango cherry".
# # Store the favorite fruit(s) in a list (convert the string of words into a list of words).
# # Now that we have a list of fruits, ask the user to input a name of any fruit.
# # If the user‚Äôs input is in the favorite fruits list, print ‚ÄúYou chose one of your favorite fruits! Enjoy!‚Äù.
# # If the user‚Äôs input is NOT in the list, print, ‚ÄúYou chose a new fruit. I hope you enjoy‚Äù.

# Exercise 8: Who Ordered A Pizza ?
# Instructions
# Write a loop that asks a user to enter a series of pizza toppings, when the user inputs ‚Äòquit‚Äô stop asking for toppings.
toppings = ""
while True:
    toppings = input("Enter a pizza topping: ")
    PROMPT(f"{toppings} were added to your pizza")
    if toppings == "quit":
        break
# As they enter each topping, print a message saying you‚Äôll add that topping to their pizza.
# Upon exiting the loop print all the toppings on the pizza pie and what the total price is (10 + 2.5 for each topping).

# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person‚Äôs age.
# if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.

# Ask a family the age of each person who wants a ticket.
# Store the total cost of all the family‚Äôs tickets and print it out.

# A group of teenagers are coming to your movie theater and want to watch a movie that is restricted for people between the ages of 16 and 21.
# Given a list of names, write a program that asks teenager for their age, if they are not permitted to watch the movie, remove them from the list.
# At the end, print the final list.
ages = int(input(f"What is {name}'s age?"))
