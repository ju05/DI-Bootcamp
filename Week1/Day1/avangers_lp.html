        <p>"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians, 
            a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.
            Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as 
            Vikings and became part of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,
