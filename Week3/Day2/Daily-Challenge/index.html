first story

In Israel, the birthday person wears a crown of flowers at the party, so we each made our own. All
it takes is some floral wire and strong tape, as well as leaves and flowers for decoration. We all took
selfies wearing our new crowns and shared them on Instagram.
At the party, we took turns being lifted up on a chair by our friends while we danced and sang Israeli
birthday songs. My favorite was Eifo Ha’Ugah? meaning ‘Where is the Cake?’ That reminded us to bring
in the huge cake we had baked and frosted with the map of Israel. We counted out, placed on the cake,
and carefully lit the candles. Together, we blew out the candles and each made a birthday wish. What
would be your wish for Israel this year?

second story
Many call hummus the national food of Israel. The country is filled with restaurants whose menus feature
nothing but plates of hummus with a variety of extras. Hummus can be an appetizer, a side dish, or a
meal; it all depends on how hungry you are! Arab cuisine features hummus, and Israel and neighboring
Arab countries have long tussled over who makes it the best. Lebanon even asked the European Union to
recognize hummus as a uniquely Lebanese dish—but that hasn’t stopped Israeli chefs from competing to
win the Guinness Book of World Records’ recognition as the makers of the largest platter of hummus.
 
third story 

Israelis take beach life seriously. Sports is an example of a passion and hobby that flourishes on or near
the beach. The sea is an awesome place for surfing, swimming, paddle boarding, boating, and all kinds of
water sports. There are great coral reefs in the Red Sea in the south near Eilat, which makes for a stunning
snorkeling experience—and that’s just in the water! There are beachfront boardwalks, perfect for walking,
running, or biking…or just for chilling, getting a coffee or ice cream, and watching the world go by. In recent
years, outdoor gyms have appeared by the beaches more and more. It’s great to work out and then relax
and cool off in the sea.
